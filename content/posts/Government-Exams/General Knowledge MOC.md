# Foundational Concepts & Topic Prioritization

The GK section is a mix of two major components: **Static GK** (which never changes) and **Current Affairs** (which changes daily). This plan integrates both. The syllabus is prioritized based on weightage in most exams (SSC, Railways, State exams).

## Module 1: Core Static (High-Weightage) 🏛️

These topics form the backbone of the static section. A significant portion of questions comes from here.

1. **Polity**: Making of the Constitution, Schedules, Articles, Fundamental Rights, DPSP, President, Parliament, Judiciary, Constitutional Bodies.
    
2. **Modern History**: The Indian National Movement (1857-1947), Governor-Generals, social reforms.
    
3. **Geography**: Indian Geography (Rivers, Mountains, Climate, Soil), Physical Geography (Solar System, Atmosphere), Census.
    

## Module 2: Science & Economics (Conceptual) 🔬

This module is conceptual and highly scoring if understood correctly.

1. **Science (Biology)**: Human Body Systems (Digestive, Nervous, etc.), Vitamins & Diseases, Cell Biology, Plant Kingdom.
    
2. **Science (Physics & Chemistry)**: SI Units, Motion, Light, Electricity, Common Chemical Names & Formulas, Acids & Bases.
    
3. **Economics**: Basics of Indian Economy, 5-Year Plans, RBI & Monetary Policy, Budget & Taxation, Inflation, GDP.
    

## Module 3: Miscellaneous Static (Memorization) 📚

This is a vast, fact-based module. It is best learned through daily practice and previous year questions.

## Module 4: Current Affairs (The Daily Driver) 📰

This runs _in parallel_ to all other modules from Day 1. It is the most important section in many modern exams.

1. **National & International News**: Appointments, Summits, Govt. Schemes.
    
2. **Economy & Banking**: RBI circulars, GDP forecasts, Mergers.
    
3. **Awards & Honours**: Nobel, Padma Awards, Sports Awards.

# A 12-Week Phased Study Timeline

This schedule balances Static GK learning with the essential daily habit of Current Affairs.

## Phase 1: Building the Core (Weeks 1-4) 🏛️

Goal: Master the high-weightage static topics and build a solid Current Affairs routine.

- **Daily Habit (Compulsory)**: 1 Hour of Current Affairs (Video/Notes + Quiz).
    
- **Week 1**: Polity (Part 1: Making of Constitution, Schedules, Articles, FR, DPSP).
    
- **Week 2**: Polity (Part 2: President, Parliament, Judiciary, Amendments).
    
- **Week 3**: Modern History (Revolt of 1857, INC formation, Gandhian Era).
    
- **Week 4**: Geography (Part 1: Indian Rivers, Mountains, National Parks, Physical Geo).
    

## Phase 2: Expanding the Base (Weeks 5-8) 🔬

Goal: Cover conceptual topics (Science/Eco) and start consolidating monthly Current Affairs.

- **Daily Habit**: 1 Hour of Current Affairs + **Start Weekly/Monthly CA Revision**.
    
- **Week 5**: Geography (Part 2: Climate, Soil, Agriculture, Census) + Economics (Part 1).
    
- **Week 6**: Economics (Part 2: RBI, Budget, Planning, etc.).
    
- **Week 7**: Science (Focus on Biology: Human Body, Diseases, Vitamins).
    
- **Week 8**: Science (Physics & Chemistry: Key concepts, units, formulas). Start full Static GK PYP quizzes.
    

## Phase 3: Finishing & Revision (Weeks 9-12) 🚀

Goal: Cover memory-based topics and aggressively revise everything.

- **Daily Habit**: 1 Hour of Current Affairs + **Revise Last 6 Months' CA**.

- **Week 12**: The Mock Gauntlet. Take one full-length GK sectional mock daily. Aggressively revise your "New Information" notebook and the last 6 months of CA.
    

# The Ideal Daily Study Routine (90-120 Mins)

GK requires two different approaches every single day.

- **First 60 Mins: Current Affairs (Must be done daily)**
    
    - **30 Mins**: Watch a daily Current Affairs video (e.g., Ashish Gautam, Kapil Kathpal).
        
    - **15 Mins**: Read a daily CA PDF/website post and make _very_ short notes (one-liners) in a dedicated notebook.
        
    - **15 Mins**: Attempt a daily CA quiz on a practice app (Testbook, Adda247, etc.). This is vital for retention.
        
- **Next 45-60 Mins: Static GK (As per 12-week plan)**
    
    - **30-40 Mins**: Conceptual Learning. Read the topic for the day from a standard book (e.g., Lucent's chapter on "Fundamental Rights").
        
    - **15-20 Mins**: Deliberate Practice. Immediately solve Previous Year Questions (PYQs) _only_ on the topic you just read. This is the fastest way to learn.
        

# Recommended Resources

- **Standard Textbooks (Choose ONE)**:
    
    - **"General Knowledge" by Lucent's**: The most popular, comprehensive, and concise book for Static GK.
        
    - **"General Knowledge" by Manohar Pandey (Arihant)**: A good alternative to Lucent's, with a slightly different layout.
        
- **Current Affairs Sources**:
    
    - **YouTube Channels**: Ashish Gautam (Adda247), Kapil Kathpal (Guidely), Indrologus.
        
    - **Monthly Magazines**: Pratiyogita Darpan (very detailed) or Chronicle.
        
    - **Websites/Apps**: Testbook, Adda247, Oliveboard, Jagran Josh for daily quizzes and PDFs.
        
- **Practice & PYPs (Most Important)**:
    
    - **Ghatna Chakra (for SSC/Railways)**: Provides topic-wise PYQs with detailed explanations.
        
    - **Kiran Prakashan (Topic-wise PYPs)**: An excellent bank of questions.
        

# Practice & Mock Test Strategy

Your success in GK is 100% dependent on revision.

## Practice Strategy

- **PYPs are Everything**: For Static GK, 70% of your learning will come from solving Previous Year Questions. Many questions repeat directly.
    
- **Link Static to Current**: When you read about a National Park in Current Affairs, immediately find its location, river, and other static facts.
    
- **CA Revision Cycle**:
    
    - **Daily**: Learn new CA.
        
    - **Weekend**: Revise all CA from the past week.
        
    - **Month-End**: Revise the entire month's CA from a compiled PDF or video.
        

## Mock Test Strategy

- **GK Mocks are different**: You either know the answer or you don't. Speed is not the issue; knowledge is.
    
- **Don't Guess**: In the real exam, wild guessing in GK is the fastest way to get negative marks. Practice this restraint in mocks.
    

# The Art of Mock Analysis 🔬

Your GK "Mistake Notebook" is your ultimate revision guide. It's not for "mistakes" but for "new information."

1. **Current Affairs You Missed**: Write down the one-line fact you didn't know.
    
    - _Example_: "Exercise 'Maitree' 2025: India & Thailand."
        
2. **Static Fact You Missed**: Write the fact.
    
    - _Example_: "Article 72: Pardoning power of the President."
        
    - _Example_: "Tanjore Brihadeeswara Temple: Built by Raja Raja Chola I."
        
3. **Confusing Facts (The "Oops" Section)**: Write down facts you confused.
    
    - _Example_: "President's Election: Article 54/55. // President's Impeachment: Article 61."
        
    - _Example_: "Classical Dance: Sattriya (Assam), _not_ Bihu (Folk Dance, Assam)."
        

Your goal is to fill this notebook. Before the final exam, revising this notebook and your monthly CA notes will be more valuable than re-reading the entire textbook. Good luck! 👍
