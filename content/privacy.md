Raaghav Bhardwaj ("I", "me", or "my") operates the website (the "Service").

My goal is to share my notes and learnings while collecting as little of your personal information as possible. This policy explains the minimal, essential data that is collected for the website to function.

## **1. Data I Do NOT Collect**

First, let's be clear about what I don't do:

- I **do not** have an email newsletter.
    
- I **do not** use Google Analytics or other detailed tracking software.
    
- I **do not** use advertising trackers or sell any data.
    
- I **do not** require you to create an account to read the blog.
    

Your visit is largely anonymous to me.

## **2. The Minimal Data That Is Collected**

**A. When You Read the Blog (Automatic & Essential)**

Like virtually every website on the internet, my web server needs to process some basic information to show you the blog. This includes:

- **Server Log Data:** Your IP address, browser type, and the pages you request are stored in the server's log files. This is a standard security and maintenance feature. This data is used to prevent malicious attacks and diagnose technical problems. It is not used to personally identify you.
    

**B. When You Choose to Leave a Comment (Voluntary)**

If you decide to leave a comment on a post, the commenting system will ask for:

- **Your Name:** This will be displayed publicly with your comment.
    
- **Your Email Address:** This is **not** displayed publicly. It is required only to verify that you are a real person and to help prevent spam.
    

If you do not wish to share this information, please do not leave a comment.

**(Note:** If you have disabled comments on your blog, you can remove section 2B entirely.)

## **3. Who Has Access to This Data?**

I am the only person with access to the content on the blog. The only third party involved is my web hosting provider, which maintains the server where the log data is stored.

## **4. Your Rights**

Even with this minimal data collection, you have rights. If you have left a comment on this site, you can request to see the information you provided or ask me to delete your comment at any time. To do so, please contact me.
## **5. Links to Other Websites**

My blog may contain links to other websites. If you click on a link, you will be directed to that site. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content or privacy practices of any other website.

## **6. Changes to This Policy**

If I ever change my blog in a way that requires collecting more data (for example, by adding analytics), I will update this policy first.

## **7. Contact Me**

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact me through the contact information provided on this website.
